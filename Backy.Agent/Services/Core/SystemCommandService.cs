    /// - Standardized error handling and logging
    /// - Command execution with timeout support
    /// - Process management capabilities
    /// - Consistent output formatting

    /// This implementation replaces scattered command execution throughout the application,
    /// enforcing a single, well-tested approach to interacting with the system.
